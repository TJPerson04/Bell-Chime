This is a project for The Sanctuary Museum, a nonprofit museum in Lakewood, Ohio situated in an old church. This project was made to control the timing of the bells so that they ring a specific number of times at specific times of the day.
This project is made to run on a Raspberry Pi 4 that is connected to the speaker system.
