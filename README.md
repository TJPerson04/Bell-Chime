This is a project for The Sanctuary Museum, a nonprofit museum in Lakewood, Ohio situated in an old church. This project was made to control the timing of the bells so that they ring a specific number of times at specific times of the day.
This project is made to run on a Raspberry Pi 4 that is connected to the speaker system.
The Raspberry Pi should also run main.py on boot so that when it reboots it automatically runs the program again.

Currently line 23 in main.py is commented out for safety reasons. In actual application that line would not be commented out.
